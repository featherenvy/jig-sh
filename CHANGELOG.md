## Unreleased

### Added
- Add Jig local development proxy commands for stable repo-scoped dev hostnames, HTTP/HTTPS forwarding, WebSocket support, workspace app discovery, local certificates, and service file generation.
- Add `scripts/jig dev` and `scripts/jig proxy {start,stop,list,prune,run,alias}` runtime flows for supervised app processes, aliases, and route listing/pruning.
- Add `scripts/jig proxy cert {generate,status,trust,untrust}` and `scripts/jig proxy service {install,status,uninstall}` for certificate trust management and user service installation; trust-store mutations require `--accept-trust-scope`, and `proxy service install` requires `--accept-service-scope`.
- Enable the `dev-proxy` Cargo feature by default while preserving `--no-default-features` builds for contract/MCP-only consumers.

### Changed
- Default release builds of `jig init` and `jig adopt` to the official `jig-sh` template source pinned to the installed Jig version's release tag; unreleased or dirty local builds now refuse that implicit release pin and require `--template /path/to/jig-sh` or `--vcs-ref <ref>` so local binaries do not render stale release templates.
- Make the generated `scripts/jig` runtime the primary command contract with `contract_version = 2`; `jig adopt` now leaves an existing project `Makefile` unmanaged by default and records `makefile_enabled = false`, while new repos still render an optional Makefile adapter.
- Change the default generated `bootstrap_command` from `make deps` to `cargo fetch` so default command-backed repos do not require a generated Makefile. Repos with web apps should set an explicit `bootstrap_command` when bootstrap must install web dependencies.
- Render schema-check commands, tools, gates, and Makefile adapter targets only when both SQLx and schema dumps are enabled; SQLx-only repos keep `sqlx-check` and migration support without a disabled placeholder schema gate.
- Command-backed `.jig.toml` `*_command` values now run through non-login `bash -c`; put any required toolchain setup in the configured command or project-owned scripts. `scripts/jig bootstrap` is available in contract version 2 repos; legacy contract version 1 repos should continue using their generated Makefile bootstrap target until updated.
- Generated Cargo command defaults now skip with exit 0 and a stdout note when no root `Cargo.toml` exists, so harness-only repos can verify immediately after `jig init`.
- Regenerating defaults with `jig update --recopy` rewrites `bootstrap_command`, `rust_fmt_check_command`, `rust_clippy_command`, `rust_test_command`, and `rust_test_locked_command` to the no-root-`Cargo.toml` skip form unless the repo has customized those answers.
- `scripts/jig work check` now rejects unknown or closed plan IDs before running tools; `scripts/jig work gates` still reports status for any existing plan, including closed plans.
- Release automation that builds Jig from a git checkout should fetch tags before building, or set `JIG_ASSUME_RELEASE_BUILD=1` after validating the workspace version and release tag.
- BREAKING for local dogfooding: resolve `JIG_DEV_BIN` directly instead of copying it into the Jig cache, so local runtime changes use the current development binary after version validation.
- Hard-fail `scripts/install-jig.sh` when `JIG_DEV_BIN` is set but missing, non-executable, or resolves to a binary whose version does not match the generated repo instead of falling back to cached runtime selection. Direct callers of `scripts/install-jig.sh` should use `scripts/jig`, set a matching `JIG_DEV_BIN`, unset it, or run the normal cached installer path.
- Split the local development proxy runtime into the `jig-dev-proxy` workspace crate used by the `jig-sh` CLI.
- Refuse to share an unrelated proxy found on the requested HTTP port unless it is registered in the same proxy state directory.
- Prune legacy live process routes that do not have process start tokens on platforms where Jig can verify process start identity.
- BREAKING: Strictly reject unknown `.jig.toml` config fields so typos and stale local config fail fast.
- Migration note: remove or rename unknown `.jig.toml` keys reported by the load error before rerunning `scripts/jig`; previously ignored local keys now block startup. This applies to top-level keys plus `[work]`, `[agent_tooling]`, `[agent_tooling.codex]`, `[dev]`, `[[dev.apps]]`, and legacy `[[frontend_apps]]` entries.
- BREAKING migration note: Jig now rejects new `schema_dump_enabled = true` answers unless `sqlx_enabled = true`; `jig update --recopy` normalizes legacy SQLx-disabled repos that still have `schema_dump_enabled = true` back to `false`.
- `jig-sh` now enables the `dev-proxy` feature by default, which pulls in the TLS/HTTP proxy stack for library consumers unless they opt into `default-features = false`.
- MCP/contract-only consumers can build with `default-features = false`; in that profile, `dev` and `proxy` still parse but return clear unsupported-feature errors instead of linking the proxy stack.
- Keep `web_package_manager = "bun"` as the default for legacy `[[frontend_apps]]`; configure `dev.apps` or set explicit commands when legacy apps should launch with another package manager.
- Require `--accept-trust-scope` before installing the Jig Dev Proxy local CA through the platform trust tooling.
- Vite proxy host support relies on Vite's `__VITE_ADDITIONAL_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS` compatibility hook; configure Vite `server.allowedHosts` explicitly if a Vite release changes that hook.
- Windows builds parse and run non-certificate proxy flows, but automatic HTTPS certificate generation/trust remains unsupported until owner-only ACL hardening for private key files is implemented.
- Document `JIG_PROXY_STATE_DIR`, proxy CA trust scope, and local dev proxy usage more explicitly.

### Security
- Harden proxy stop, certificate writes, CA regeneration, and TLS handshake behavior for local development sessions.
- Harden Vite argument handling, including rejection of mismatched explicit Vite port flags, backend response parsing, WebSocket proxy-header scrubbing, and route-cache invalidation.
- Harden LAN proxy exposure, alias registration, workspace discovery traversal, process-route liveness checks, and route persistence.
- Harden state directory permissions, service-file quoting, and local proxy shutdown behavior.
- Harden background proxy startup, runtime file replacement, request-host validation, installer locking, private-key reads, and workspace config file reads.
- Reverify process-route listener ownership while holding the route lock, restore the previous route file after failed route publication, isolate service temp paths, harden certificate/trust temporary reads, prefer recorded template commits for remote runtime installs, and defer release tag pushes until all crates publish successfully.
- Treat template source metadata as a runtime-install trust boundary: recorded hex `_commit` values pin the exact remote Jig revision used by `scripts/install-jig.sh`, and contract checks now keep the installer script and template mirror in sync.
- Bound the Jig Dev Proxy local CA lifetime to two years, avoid broad bare-TLD CA constraints for non-`.localhost` TLDs, and verify macOS trust installation before recording Jig's trusted-CA marker.
- Reject backend response headers with whitespace before the colon, retry transient TLS leaf cert/key rotation mismatches, escape `$` in systemd `ExecStart` values, fail closed on oversized workspace glob expansion, and extend proxy state lock waits.
- Document that shell-form `[[dev.apps]].command` and top-level `.jig.toml` `*_command` values are trusted repo-configured shell execution; prefer `argv` when app arguments should be passed literally.
