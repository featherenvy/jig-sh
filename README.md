> **Keep coding agents on contract.**

Jig turns any repository into an operating environment for coding agents. Without it, agents lose context across machines, have no stable execution contract, and leave no inspectable record of their work. Jig generates that scaffolding once — a typed command contract, MCP runtime, receipts, gates, a dev proxy, and a sealed local vault — and keeps it in sync as the harness evolves.

## What you get

- **Agent context files** (`AGENTS.md`, `agent-map.md`) so agents learn the repo layout and conventions without reading source.
- **A typed `jig` command contract** so every machine, CI run, and agent executes the same commands and leaves append-only receipts under `.agent/state/`.
- **Work gates backed by receipts** so a task cannot be marked done without a verifiable output artifact.
- **A local dev proxy** so app hostnames stay stable across port changes and machine restarts.
- **A local encrypted vault** so selected secrets resolve into brokered child processes without ever living in the repo.
- **A prompt library** so reusable prompts live outside the agent context window.
- **Repo policy scripts and CI workflows** so lint, tests, and coverage enforcement run consistently from day one.
- **Template sync via `jig update`** so the harness stays current without overwriting files you have customized.

## Install

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.85+, [Bun](https://bun.sh) (for web targets), and your database engine when SQLx is enabled.

```sh
cargo install jig-sh
```

You only need a global install to run `jig init` or `jig adopt` on a repo for the first time. Generated repos install and pin their own `jig` version automatically through `scripts/install-jig.sh`, so every contributor and CI run uses the same binary.

## Quick start

Render the harness, check readiness, and run the work loop:

```sh
# 1. Render into a new repo (or `jig adopt .` inside an existing one)
jig init ./my-app --preset rust-react --db postgres --frontends web,landing,admin

# 2. See what setup remains
cd ./my-app
scripts/jig doctor --summary

# 3. Bootstrap and verify the contract
scripts/jig bootstrap
scripts/jig agent bootstrap        # if doctor reports missing marketplace registration
scripts/jig check contract

# 4. Do work behind gates
plan_id="$(scripts/jig work start --title "First change" --body "Validate the harness loop." --print-plan-id)"
scripts/jig check test
scripts/jig work finish --plan-id "$plan_id" --resolution "Harness loop verified" --outcome success
```

`doctor` exits nonzero until required setup is complete and reports the next step to take. `--summary` is the human scan path; the default JSON form is the stable output for automation.

## How it works

1. **Render the harness.** `jig init` (greenfield) or `jig adopt` (existing repo) renders the template into your project: `scripts/jig`, agent context files, CI workflows, and MCP config — pinned to a template version. `scripts/jig` is the generated command surface for everything below.
2. **Work behind gates.** Agents run the same typed commands on every machine. Each `check` and `work` step appends a receipt under `.agent/state/`, so a task can't be closed without verifiable evidence.
3. **Stay in sync.** `jig update` pulls template improvements without clobbering files you've changed — they are never overwritten without `--force`.

## The command contract

`.agent/jig-contract.json` records the stable command tools that MCP clients and CI can execute across machines. Runtime-owned commands manage local workflow state, processes, or secrets and are intentionally outside the generated contract.

| Surface         | Stable contract? | Records receipts? | Machine-local? |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| `check`         | yes              | yes               | no             |
| `work`          | runtime-owned    | yes               | no             |
| `prompt`        | runtime-owned    | no                | partly         |
| `dev` / `proxy` | runtime-owned    | no                | yes            |
| `vault`         | runtime-owned    | no                | yes            |

For local validation, call the contract commands directly:

```sh
scripts/jig check fmt
scripts/jig check clippy
scripts/jig check test
```

These append receipts under `.agent/state/`. Pass `--no-receipt` to a one-off command when you don't want evidence recorded. Read existing state with `scripts/jig work status --summary`, `scripts/jig work evidence --summary`, and `scripts/jig work receipts --summary --failed-only`.

See [Public Contract](docs/public-contract.md) and [Developer UX](docs/developer-ux.md) for the full surface.

## Creating and adopting repos

**Greenfield, harness only:**

```sh
jig init /path/to/target-repo --repo-name target-repo --sqlx-enabled false
```

**Greenfield Rust backend + React frontends.** Run `jig presets` to see available presets and their generated layout, then:

```sh
jig init /path/to/target-repo --preset rust-react --db postgres --frontends web,landing,admin
```

This scaffolds a Cargo workspace (`apps/<repo>-api`, `crates/<repo>-core`, `crates/<repo>`, `crates/<repo>-http`, `crates/<repo>-test-support`, optional `crates/<repo>-db`) plus frontend apps (Vite React `web`/`admin-panel`, Astro `landing`). The app crate owns typed `AppConfig`/`AppState`; the API binary loads `.env` with `dotenvy`; the HTTP crate owns the Axum router, handlers, middleware, and health endpoints. The scaffold includes a root `.env.example` for local settings and ignores local `.env` files. Preset application code is generated once and then becomes **project-owned** — `jig update` keeps the harness current but never migrates or overwrites your application source.

**Adopt an existing repo.** `jig adopt` scans first and previews managed-file changes; re-run with `--write` after reviewing:

```sh
cd /path/to/target-repo
jig adopt .            # preview
jig adopt . --write    # apply
```

Adopt infers the repo name, default branch, Rust crate roots, SQLx/migrations, frontend apps, and CI `runs-on` values. Override anything with explicit flags (e.g. `--sqlx-enabled false`), or add `--json` for the full detection report. Existing root files like `AGENTS.md` and `Makefile` stay repo-owned — adopt only inserts or updates its marked block.

**Update an adopted repo:**

```sh
cd /path/to/target-repo
jig update             # advance to the current template, preserving your changes
jig update --recopy    # re-render from stored .jig.toml answers without advancing
```

`jig update` refuses to overwrite changed template-managed files unless `--force` is passed. `.jig.toml` is both the public repo config and the renderer answers file.

See [Adoption](docs/adoption.md) and [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for the complete flag reference and update/versioning rules.

## Feature reference

### Structured work & receipts

`work start` opens a plan, `check` runs gates, and `work finish` closes a plan only after fresh evidence exists. Contract and gate commands append receipts under `.agent/state/`, giving every change a reviewable trail. See [Developer UX](docs/developer-ux.md#work-receipts-and-gate-evidence).

### Vault

Jig Vault stores selected local secrets outside the repo, unlocks them with a local passphrase, and injects only requested values into a brokered child process. Generated repos use a repo-scoped local vault by default.

```sh
scripts/jig vault init
scripts/jig vault secret set api_token --value-prompt
scripts/jig vault run --env TOKEN=api_token -- sh -c 'printf "%s\n" "$TOKEN"'
scripts/jig vault audit verify
```

Terminal use prompts for the passphrase; for non-interactive callers export `JIG_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`. `vault run --env VAR=SECRET` injects values as environment variables; on Unix, `--file VAR=SECRET` writes the secret to a private `0600` temp file and injects its path. Vault output is JSON and child secrets are redacted. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#vault-runtime) for scopes, `--global`, and automation details.

### Prompts

Jig Prompt stores reusable prompts outside the agent context window. Prompts can be user-level, repo-level, or distributed through read-only prompt packs.

```sh
scripts/jig prompt add comprehensive-review-loop --file prompt.md --tag review
scripts/jig prompt get comprehensive-review-loop
scripts/jig prompt get repo:release-checklist --var base=main
scripts/jig prompt list
scripts/jig prompt search review
```

`prompt get` is the exact-output primitive: it prints only the rendered prompt body, with no envelope or added newline. Bodies render as MiniJinja templates (`--var KEY=VALUE`, or `--raw` to skip rendering). Names may be namespaced with `user:`, `repo:`, or `pack:<pack>/`; unqualified writes default to `user:` and `pack:` prompts are read-only. Common subcommands have shell-style aliases (`cat`, `cp`, `new`, `rm`, `ls`, `find`).

### Local dev proxy

Generated repos run supervised dev commands behind stable local hostnames, so app URLs survive port changes and restarts.

```sh
scripts/jig dev
scripts/jig proxy alias api --port 8080
scripts/jig proxy list
```

For HTTPS, generate and explicitly trust a local, name-constrained CA:

```sh
scripts/jig proxy cert generate
scripts/jig proxy cert trust --accept-trust-scope
```

`--accept-trust-scope` acknowledges platform trust-store mutation. Automatic cert management and process-owned routes are supported on macOS and Linux; on Windows and BSD-like platforms run apps directly with `scripts/jig proxy run --no-proxy` or manage loopback services with `scripts/jig proxy alias`. See [Developer UX](docs/developer-ux.md).

## Required repo conventions

All generated repos are expected to use Cargo workspaces, `cargo fmt`, and `cargo clippy`. When `sqlx_enabled` is `true`, repos also use SQLx workspace metadata (e.g. `.sqlx/`) and repo-owned migrations.

Optional web apps must expose `lint`, `typecheck`, `build:bundle`, and `test:coverage` package scripts in each app directory. `test:coverage` must write `coverage/coverage-summary.json` so generated checks can enforce the threshold. The default workflow assumes Bun for package install and script execution.

## Templates and versioning

A *template* is the source repo whose files are rendered into your project. Release builds of `jig init`/`jig adopt` use the official `jig-sh` template, pinned to the release tag for the installed Jig version. Pass `--template` only to dogfood a local checkout, fork, or private template:

```sh
jig init ./my-app --template /path/to/jig-sh --template-mode committed
```

Unreleased or dirty local builds use the templates embedded in the binary. When editing files under `templates/project`, refresh the packaged snapshot before committing:

```sh
JIG_REFRESH_EMBEDDED_TEMPLATE_SNAPSHOT=1 cargo check -p jig-sh
```
